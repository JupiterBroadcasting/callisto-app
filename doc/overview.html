Callisto is a fan-made app centered around the podcasting network "Jupiter Broadcasting." It was made primarily by MrQweex (aka notbryant aka Jon), but is really a community project for anyone to contribute.

First let me preface by saying that Callisto is the very first app I've ever made, period, for any mobile device.
With that in mind, there will undoubtedly be things that you see that are done stupidly, and sometimes I see them too. I wrote Callisto after one summer class in Mobile Development, during which we mostly just modified existing code. So Callisto was as much a learning experience for me as it was a project.
