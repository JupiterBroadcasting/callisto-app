This semi-major version update is one step closer to a stable 1.0 release.
It includes several fixes to issues submitted to Github page, but please remember that the 'Protostar' means 'Beta'.

    Fix: Error updating feeds -- Fixed an unfortunately common error about becoming a monk.
    Fix: Widget -- The widget should now be themed to match the app, and hopefully work more reliably.
    Fix: IRC commands -- Some commands (e.g. /NAMES) would crash the app, and have hopefully been fixed. Thanks, nogal!
    Feature: JBTitle -- Preliminary support for the JBTitles voting system.
    Feature: Twitter -- Preliminary support for following the hosts on Twitter.
	Special Thanks -- ??? -- JupiterBroadcasting, for being awesome, as always.

If you have a problem or question, please don't 1-star the app without at least filing an issue on Github or sending me an e-mail. Neither of them cost you anything, barely take you any time, and helps me tremendously to make Callisto better for you.

This release is dedicated to ????
