This semi-minor version update is one step closer to a stable 1.0 release.
It includes several fixes to issues submitted to Github page, but please remember that the 'Protostar' means 'Beta'.

    NEW SHOW: Linux Unplugged! -- Jupiter Broadcasting's new show about Linux and the community.
    Fix: Error updating feeds -- Fixed an unfortunately common error about becoming a monk.
    Fix: Widget -- The widget should now be themed to match the app, and hopefully work more reliably.
    Fix: IRC commands -- Some commands (e.g. /NAMES) would crash the app, and have hopefully been fixed. Thanks, nogal!
    Feature: JBTitle -- Preliminary support for the JBTitles voting system.
    Note: Localization -- WAY better support for localization! If you're interested in helping translate, e-mail me at MrQweex@qweex.com
    Note: Cleaner logcat -- Messages in the log should now show the class, method, and line number in the tag, AND "Callisto".
    Note: New Github -- The project (or rather my profile) has moved to https://github.com/notbryant/callisto-app. Old links should hopefully redirect.
	Special Thanks -- rikai & wd-40 & nekinie, for filing isssuuuuueeees -- JupiterBroadcasting, for being awesome, as always.

If you have a problem or question, please don't 1-star the app without at least filing an issue on Github or sending me an e-mail. Neither of them cost you anything, barely take you any time, and helps me tremendously to make Callisto better for you.

This release is dedicated to ????
