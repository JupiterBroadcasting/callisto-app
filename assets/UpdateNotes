It includes 9 fixes to issues submitted to Callisto's Google Code page, but please remember that the 'Protostar' means 'Beta'.

	Feature: Update notes -- A list of new features for this release.
	Fix: Wi-fi connectivity -- Wi-fi should stay connected during streaming.
	Fix: Irssi mode -- Irssi mode should now work correctly with colors.
	Fix: Crash while rotate -- Fixed several cases of crashing when rotating & loading.
	Fix: On-boot crash -- Finally fixed the on-boot-received. I sincerely hope so.

	Fix: New/Seen -- Fixed the ability to toggle new or not new in show lists.
	Fix: Now Playing info -- The now playing should now be updated at all times.
	Feature: IRC Background -- Added the ability to set the background color. Consequently, nick colors may be less interesting now.
	Feature: More "Stop" -- Added Stop menus....EVERYWHERE!
	Feature: BACON! -- Added a special feature for people who donate ;)
	
	Special Thanks -- BlastyrWurm, crshbnct, & nogal, For submitting so many bugs to Google Code and testing them for me -- chz|bacon, For helping me get a ICS running device -- JupiterBroadcasting, for being awesome, as always.

If you have a problem or question, please don't 1-star the app without at least filing an issue on Google Code or sending me an e-mail. Neither of them cost you anything, barely take you any time, and helps me tremendously to make Callisto better for you.

This release is dedicated to Jason, in hopes that he will forgive a very busy college student who is honestly trying his hardest without sacrificing his future career."
