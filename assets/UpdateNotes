This minor version update introduces several bugfixes. 
It includes several fixes to issues submitted to Callisto's Google Code page, but please remember that the 'Protostar' means 'Beta'.

	Fix: Network handling -- Better handling for a crappy or nonexistent network connection.
	Fix: Timezone -- Should be fixed for timezone translation for the calendar.
	Feature: Non-US dates -- Fixed the order for dates for "dd/mm" people.
	Fix: Crash on rotate -- Fixed crashing when rotating with a progress dialog open.
	Fix: IRC Background -- Fixed the background not sticking; other color settings should better as well.
	Fix: Calendar days misalign -- Calendar days in landscape should now be all the same height.
	Feature: IRC timeout -- Will try to connect until a specified time.
	Feature: IRC retries -- Upon given an issue, will retry multiple times.
	Fix: IRC message discrenpencies -- Fixed messages being skipped, going to the wrong screen, or duplicating.
	Fix: IRC auto-identify -- This should now work flawlessly, assuming you enter the right password.
	Feature: IRC obfusication -- Encryption is impossible for locally stored passwords, but obfusication is now done on nicks & passwords.
	Special Thanks -- VoNWooDSoN, for being the first other person to make a commit to the project -- sikory & joren, for helping with the obfusication problem -- JupiterBroadcasting, for being awesome, as always.

If you have a problem or question, please don't 1-star the app without at least filing an issue on Google Code or sending me an e-mail. Neither of them cost you anything, barely take you any time, and helps me tremendously to make Callisto better for you.

This release is dedicated to nogal, for just generally being awesome; thanks for all the encouragement, continual bug reports, and just niceness about you.
